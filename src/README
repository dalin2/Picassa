Part I Design
Started: 1/19/12 Finished: 1/25/12
I expected to work on this for somewhere between 5-10 hours and I don't know exactly how long it took me, but it took
way longer than i expected.

I discussed the assignment with Becky DeNardis, Professor Hewner, and my TA Mason Meier.
I used Head First design and other resources given in class.

I had a lot of difficulty with getting the design to an appropriate place although I do think it is a good assignment.
